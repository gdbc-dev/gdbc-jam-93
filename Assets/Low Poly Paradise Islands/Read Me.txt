Hello and thank you for purchasing Low Poly Paradise Islands Package.

************

"IMPORTANT"
1. Go to Edit/Project Settings/Player and Set Color Space to Linear to achieve similar rendering.

2. You need to have Unity Standard Assets/Environment imported to your project in order to have the water prefabs work properly.

3. Prefabs are set to static. So if animating or having dynamic objects uncheck the static.

************


Spike Tower 01 and Spike Tower 03 have separate parts for animation.

Texture is 512*512 png

There are 66 prefabs.
